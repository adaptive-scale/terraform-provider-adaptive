# Adaptive Provider

You can use the Adaptive Terraform provider to configure and manage your Adaptive account and resources. This project allows you to leverage Terraform to complete the following tasks in Adaptive:

- CRUD resources / integrations
- CRUD sessions
<!-- - CRUD authorizations -->

## Example Usage

To install the Adaptive provider, copy and paste this code into your Terraform configuration.

```hcl
# Install StrongDM provider
terraform {
  required_providers {
    sdm = {
      source = "adaptive.live/adaptive"
      version = ">=3.3.0"
    }
  }
}


provider "adaptive" {
  # Add configuration options
  service_token = "<service_token>"
}
```

## Configuration

To configure the provider for use, you must add [Service Token](https://docs.adaptive.live/). Generate the token using your User Settings Page.

Now you can you that token like so:

You can use the token:

1. (Recommended) Export to environment variable

   ```bash
   # set env vars
   $ export ADAPTIVE_SVC_TOKEN="<service_token>"
   $ terraform plan
   ```

2. Plain text secret

   ```bash
   provider "adaptive" {
     # Add configuration options
     service_token = "<service_token>"
   }
   ```

3. if you want to use adaptive-cli token instead:

   ```bash
   # this will store the token in ~/.adaptive/token
   $ adaptive login
   ```

   ```hcl
   provider "adaptive" {
     # Add configuration options
     service_token = "<service_token>"
   }
   ```
